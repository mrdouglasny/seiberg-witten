# Modular `λ` uniformization of the SU(2) base — building the framework

The SU(2) rigidity gap `AX_su2_modular_frame_alignment` (`SU2Rigidity.lean`) rests on the
uniformization of the thrice-punctured base by the upper half plane. This file builds the
framework: it **proves** the reachable identification and isolates the genuine analytic
content as a single classical statement.

## What is proved (column 1)

`su2BaseEquiv`: the SU(2) Coulomb branch is the **standard thrice-punctured sphere**. The
affine map `u ↦ (u+Λ²)/(2Λ²)` is a bijection `ℂ ∖ {±Λ²} ≃ ℂ ∖ {0,1}`, sending the
monopole/dyon points `−Λ², Λ²` to `0, 1`. So the rigidity question transports to the
*standard* base `ℂ ∖ {0,1}`, where the modular `λ`-function lives.

## What is isolated (the deep theorem)

`ThricePuncturedUniformization` packages the classical fact that the modular `λ`-function
realizes `ℍ` as the **universal cover** of `ℂ ∖ {0,1}` with deck group `Γ(2)`:
`λ : ℍ → ℂ∖{0,1}` is `Γ(2)`-invariant, surjective, and its fibres are exactly the
`Γ(2)`-orbits. The single axiom `AX_thrice_punctured_uniformization` asserts this exists.

It is **not vacuous**: surjectivity onto the (infinite) `ℂ∖{0,1}` rules out trivial models,
so this genuinely asserts the uniformization. Mathlib has the raw materials —
`CongruenceSubgroup.Gamma N` and `jacobiTheta` (from which `λ = θ₂⁴/θ₃⁴` is built) — but
neither `λ` itself nor the covering theorem; constructing them is a standalone
Mathlib-scale project (a natural contribution). This axiom is the precise classical
statement that remains.

## How this discharges the rigidity gap

`AX_su2_modular_frame_alignment` asked for a modular frame change aligning two period maps
with the same monodromy. With `su2BaseEquiv` (base = `ℂ∖{0,1}`) + the uniformization
(developing map `ℍ → ℂ∖{0,1}`) + the proved `g=1` `Sp`-action (`SiegelSL2.lean`) + the
identity theorem (`holo_eqOn_of_germ`), it reduces to: *two `Γ(2)`-equivariant holomorphic
maps with the same monodromy differ by a deck transformation* — a statement now entirely
about `AX_thrice_punctured_uniformization`, i.e. the one classical input. So the rigidity
debt is concentrated onto this single, well-understood theorem.
